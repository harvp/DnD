<h4>Links to relevant Dungeons and Dragons info</h4>
<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm#abilityScores">Abilities </a><br/>
<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/races.htm">Races</a> We can ignore favored classes for now.<br/>
<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/indexes/classes.htm">Classes</a> For now, ignore multiclass, prestige classes, and NPC classes.<br/>
<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/indexes/feats.htm">Feats</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/indexes/skills.htm">Skills</a> We want to keep in mind the following: does this skill have an 
armor penalty? Does it require training (at least one skill point) to use? Some feats will buff skills, and having 5 ranks in some 
skills will buff other skills.<br/>
<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/indexes/magicItems.htm">Magic Items</a> This may be a version 2 feature. Some of these are modifiers for 
existing armor or weapons, could lead to a pain trying to account for the combinations.<br/>
<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/armor.htm">Armor</a> "Maximum dexterity bonus" will need to be factored in to skills
that use Dexterity and Armor Class.<br/>
<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm">Weapons </a> There's a nice table halfway down this page.<br/>
<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/goodsAndServices.htm">Goods and services, mundane items</a> A lot of these can give bonuses
to skills in some situations. For now we just want to be able to show if a user has the item in inventory or not.<br/>
<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/index.htm">Everyting else</a><br/>

Some relevant non-code files are kept in the repository. Look for the folder labelled "OTHER FILES".
