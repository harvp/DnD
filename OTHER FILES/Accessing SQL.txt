I'm paraphrasing the instructions you can find here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/connect-query-dotnet-visual-studio

When connecting to our database, the C# script must include:

using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient;


you can then create a SqlConnection by first using string builder to create a string with the required information, and then creating a SqlConnection using that string as a parameter.


SqlConnectionStringBuilder builder = new SqlConnectionStringBuilder
            {
                DataSource = "hrpsvr.database.windows.net",
                UserID = "hrpzip",
                Password = "DBMProject1!",
                InitialCatalog = "DnD"
            };

using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(builder.ConnectionString))
            {

                string myQuery = "SELECT Top 1 * FROM Characters";

                SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(myQuery, connection);
                connection.Open();
                using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())
                {
                    while (reader.Read())
                    {
                        Message.InnerHtml = (String.Format("{0}", reader[0]));
			//"Message" is the ID of an html element on the webpage

                    }
                }
		
		connection.Close();

            }
